# LeetCode Daily Practice

Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Practice repository! Here, I share my daily solutions to LeetCode problems as I work through them regularly.

## About

This repository contains Java solutions to various LeetCode problems, primarily focusing on easy and medium difficulty levels. I commit my solutions daily to track my progress and practice coding skills.

## Structure

Each problem is solved in a separate Java file, named descriptively with the problem name and LeetCode number.

## How to Use

- Clone the repository
- Each `.java` file contains the solution to a specific problem
- Run the Java files using your preferred Java environment (e.g., `javac` and `java`)

## Progress
